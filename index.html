<p>I am a graduate student in the <a href="https://boris.people.uic.edu/index.html">Igic Lab</a> at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
<p>My research interests include plant population genetics, self-incompatibility, aquatic and terrestrial plant ecology, and genetic mechanisms of plant adaptations to changes in water availability.</p>

<p>I received my B.Sc. from the <a href="https://uwm.edu/freshwater/">School of Freshwater Sciences</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where I studied Great Lakes ecology and phytoplankton physiology.</p>
