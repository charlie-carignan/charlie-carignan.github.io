I am a graduate student in the [Igic Lab](https://boris.people.uic.edu/index.html) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My research interests include plant population genetics, aquatic and terrestrial plant ecology, and genetic mechanisms that dictate plant adaptations to changes in water availability.  


I receieved my B.Sc. from the [School of Freshwater Sciences](https://uwm.edu/freshwater/) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where I studied Great Lakes ecology and phytoplankton physiology.
