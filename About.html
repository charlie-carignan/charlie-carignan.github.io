What started as camping and canoeing trips around Wisconsin as a kid has bloomed into a wide interest in all things ecology, particularly plants. As an undergraduate studying freshwater biology, I worked in an aquatic ecology lab where I studied invasive fish and molluscs, as well as algal physiology. The phytoplankton work further bolstered my love for photosynthetic organisms and introduced a new interest in aquatic plants and algae. I have recently become fascinated by the variety of mating systems that manifest in plants, as well as how the distributions of these mating systems differ between aquatic and terrestrial environments. More specifically, I am interested in comparing mating systems in the two extremes of global water distribution, aquatic habitats and deserts. As a result of facing completely different abiotic environments, plants in these contrasting conditions employ a wide range of mating systems, which directly inform how scientists conserve rare species and mitigate invasives. 

<p>Outside of research, I play the guitar, bass, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2zz9o2pCNCj076cU4TAgMx" target="_blank">saxophone</a>. I love making music with friends, and we are always looking for new people to play with. I also enjoy gardening, cooking, going to the gym, fishing, and exploring!</p>
